				The PlayStation console predominates the video game market with its unprecedented power and stylish design. The console can process high resolution real-time 3DCG, equivalent to the graphic quality of arcade video games, delivering radically enhanced gameplay. PlayStation heralds in a new era of video games with its revolutionizing console. The iconic triangle, circle, cross, square symbols of the unique hand-fitting controller, have since become trademarks of the PlayStation family.

			<h1>Description</h1>
			<p>The PlayStation (officially abbreviated as PS and commonly known as the PS1 or its codename PSX) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was first released on 3 December 1994 in Japan, on 9 September 1995 in North America, on 29 September 1995 in Europe, and on 15 November 1995 in Australia, and was the first of the PlayStation lineup of video game consoles. As a fifth generation console, the PlayStation primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn. The PlayStation was the first "computer entertainment platform" to ship over 100 million units, which it had reached nine years after its initial launch.<br><br> In July 2000, a redesigned, slim version called the PS one was released.PS one is the result of radical size-reduction of the original PlayStation, and has been condensed to approximately 1/3rd its size. The new design makes it easier for users to carry around the world of PlayStation entertainment anywhere they go. A specially designed PS one LCD monitor is introduced in November 2001 as a peripheral, providing the system with additional portability. PS one gains popularity not only as the home console but also as the portable PlayStation system.</p>
